A vending machine using React.js

Try out the React Vending Machine - Insert coins, select a product, get back exact change, and remove the product from the machine. Also, feel free to play around with the the admin buttons for stocking products and coins.

This app was built from a coding challenge to create a vending machine using only React js.
